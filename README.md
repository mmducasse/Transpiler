# Transpiler

Transpiler for a custom Haskell-like programming language called "Functional Language 1" that I created as a hobby project during Covid lockdowns.

FL1 is a functional, strict evaluating, statically typed language with Hindley-Milner type inference, parametric polymorphism, and type classes.

The transpiler parses and analyzes FL1 source code, then outputs javascript and executes it with NodeJS. It also features a REPL interface where you can evaluate FL1 expressions interactively.

Navigate to the "FL1 Code" directory for code examples.
