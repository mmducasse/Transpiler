QUESTIONS:

What types can't implement a class?

TODO:

- Make recursion, mutual recursion work
- Instance Implementors need to introduce type variables.
- Make CodePosition.Null point to some predefined module.
- Infix operators
- Make token indentation more robust
- Better code locations for errors
- Multiple modules
- Generate JavaScript
- Monomorphic operations for each primitive data type.
- Match Case Patterns can be replaced with predicates and values
  - These take the match argument as a parameter to produce Bool result
- List literals
-$0, $1, etc to represent lambda inputs
