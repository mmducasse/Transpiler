IMPROVEMENTS:

- Gn: Need to add type parameters to scope in Prepare, do this in functin args all at once

TODO:

- Add vars in REPL
- Add core libraries to project
- Make recursion, mutual recursion type checkable (batch type inference based on dependencies)

- Make private indicators do something
- Explict type annotations inline
- Operator associativity
- $0, $1, etc to represent lambda inputs
- Type aliases
- Pattern aliases
- Nested unions
- Arbitrary unions
- Precicates in match cases
